        <h2>ALL ABOUT MONET GARDEN</h2>
        <p>
          This is a website for an artist called Claude Monet. I am a big of him
          so I decided to build a community website for Monet to get more information of his works
          and also share any information which is related to him or his works. <br />
          Thank you for visiting this website and enjoy!

          <p>"All About Monet"</p>
          <p>
            Oscar-Claude Monet was a French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and the most consistent
            and prolific
            practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as
            applied to plein air landscape painting.The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his
            painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the
            independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.

            Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene
            many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons.From 1883, Monet
            lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which
            included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. He began painting the water
            lilies in 1899, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series
            of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.
