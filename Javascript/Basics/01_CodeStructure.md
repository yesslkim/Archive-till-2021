## Code structure

1. Statements (문)

   statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions

   ```javascript
   alert("Hello,world!");
   ```

2. Semicolons (세미콜론)  
    A semicolon may be ommitted in most cases when a line break exists. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.Sometimes Javascript fails to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.**it's better to always use semicolon**

3. Comments (주석)
- A single line comment - use //
- multi-line comments - use /\* \*/
- Comments cannot be nested

  ```javascript
  // a one line comment

  /*
  This is
  for
  multi-line comment
  */
  ```
