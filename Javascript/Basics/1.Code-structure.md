## Code structure

studying to build blocks of code

## Statements (문)

statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions

```javascript
alert("Hello,world!");
```

## Semicolons (세미콜론)

A semicolon may be ommitted in most cases when a line break exists. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.

- sometimes Javascript fails to assume a semicolon where it is really needed. **it's better to always use semicolon**

## Comments (주석)

There are two ways to comments in the code.
The syntax of comments

- A single line comment - use //
- multi-line comments - use /\* \*/
- Comments cannot be nested

```Javascript
// a one line comment

/*
This is
for
multi-line comment
*/
```
